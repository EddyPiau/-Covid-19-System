**Problem Statement(s):** 

The global pandemic outbreak called covid-19 has caused a tremendous calamity to the 
world population and this includes the people of Malaysia. In order to control the spread 
of the virus, a RT-PCR test is conducted to human in order to determine whether they 
have contracted the virus or not. The problem with the test is that the KKM need to keep 
record of every person who have been tested. This includes their details such as their id
card no, contact no, address, name and so on. Apart of the person’s details, KKM also need 
to keep record of every test such as the date & time of the test, the location where the test 
was taken as well as number of test conducted in a week at a particular location. 
A system is needed and will be used by both patient (Person Under Investigation-PUI) 
and KKM personnel (admin) with different functionality. The PUI should be able to enter 
their details and the admin should be able to view each PUI details and record test detail 
for the particular PUI. Once a RT-PCR test is conducted, the PUI will be able to keep 
track of their test status whether the test was a positive or negative. Test status can be 
“Pending”, “Positive” or “Negative”.
